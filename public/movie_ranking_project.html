    <h1>The Best Movies To Watch According To Chris</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>NOTE:</h3> <p> This is randomly selected and not in any particular order and also, this is not a ranking of the movies, as I love all films equally.</p>
    <h4> Dragon Ball Z: Tree of Might</h4>
    <p>Really cool anime to watch. I recommend it.</p>
    <h4>Sonic The Hedgehog 3</h4>
    <p>This film is extremely amazing, with the action-sequence which increases hype as the film progresses.</p>
    <h4>Lilo and Stitch: Live-Action</h4>
    <p>Super beautiful film. Adapted well with the original animated film.</p>
